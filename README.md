# Overview

This is a simple node.js "game" which is based off the [Alvin Lin tutorial on
Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-multiplayer-browser-game-4a793818c29b). As is mentioned in the
tutorial, this is a simple game which creates a blob for each person who joins. That blob can move around the
canvas. There are no other interactions. There are a handful of things wrong with this application, but is a good
introduction to what it might look like to do some gaming with node.js.
